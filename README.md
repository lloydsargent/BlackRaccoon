# BlackRaccoon
IOS FTP Client Code

THIS FIRMWARE NO LONGER IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT NOR IS IT SUPPORTED.

PLEASE USE EITHER A FORK OR A MORE ROBUST VERSION OF FTP.

BLACKRACCOON WAS A NON-SECURE METHOD OF FTP USING APPLE'S INTERNAL FUNCTIONS
THAT HAVE SINCE BEEN DEPRECATED/REMOVED.

Thank you to the many that have used BlackRaccoon and have forked the project.
I hope that it lives on... just with someone else!

Please note: I have NOT put BlackRaccoon into the Public Domain and STILL retain
all copyright. If you feel the need to use it from another fork, please assure
that the copyright notice remains INTACT.

Thank you!
